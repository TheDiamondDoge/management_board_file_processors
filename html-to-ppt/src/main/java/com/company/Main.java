A record may contain either other records (in which case it is a Container), or data (in which case it's an Atom). A record can't hold both. PowerPoint documents don't have one overall container record. Instead, there are a number of different container records to be found at the top level. Any numbers or strings stored in the records are always stored in Little Endian format (least important bytes first). This is the case no matter what platform the file was written on - be that a Little Endian or a Big Endian system. PowerPoint may have Escher (DDF) records embedded in it. These are always held as the children of a PPDrawing record (record type 1036). Escher records have the same format as PowerPoint records. Hello mate! Hello mate! Hello mate! Hello mate! Hello mate!
