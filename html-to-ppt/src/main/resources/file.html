    <span>PowerPoint documents are made up of a tree of records. A record may contain either other records (in which case it is a Container), or data (in which case it's an Atom). </span>
    <span> A record can't hold both. PowerPoint documents don't have one overall container record. Instead, there are a number of different container records to be found at the top level.</span>
    <span>Any <a href="http://www.google.com">numbers</a> or strings stored in the records are always stored in Little Endian format (least important bytes first). This is the case no matter what platform the file was written on - be that a Little Endian or a Big Endian system. </span>
    <span>PowerPoint may have Escher (DDF) records embedded in it. These are always held as the children of a PPDrawing record (record type 1036). Escher records have the same format as PowerPoint records.</span>
